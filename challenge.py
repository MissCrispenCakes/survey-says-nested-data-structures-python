import people from database

# All the survey responses are stored in a list called "people". (Remember to use dot syntax!)



# 1. Print out the name of the first person who responded to the survey




# 2. Print out Brenton's second favorite band




# 2. For each person on this list, print out a descriptor of where they live in the form "____ lives in _____."




# 3. Print out each person's nickname. Write some control flow that determines whether / how to respond if someone didn't provide a nickname.




# 4. Find the average of the respondents' ages.




# 5. Print out the percentage of respondents who have brown hair.




# 6. Create two new lists - one for programmers, and one for non programmers.
#    Sort all the people in the main list into these two more specific lists.




# 7. Iterate over the list in order to figure out how many respondents listed "The Office" as their one of their favorite shows.




# 8. Print out a list of all the bands that are liked by at least two people.
#    Pro-tip: some respondents capitalized band names and other respondents did not, so for example, if Panic at the Disco isn't listed, your code isn't accurately reporting your results.





# 9. Identify anyone on the list who has no common interests (bands or shows) with anyone else. Print their names.
