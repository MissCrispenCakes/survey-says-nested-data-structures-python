Hello! 
This file is an answer key of sorts.
It has the expected outputs for some of the challenges in challenge.py

Please note a few things before peeking at the answers:
* You may choose to do this entire lab without ever peeking at this file. 
* The point of these exercises is not to get the answers, it's to figure out a way that makes sense to you to get the answers. This file exists mainly to scratch that itch that asks "is this solution right?"
* Just because your outputs don't match the ones listed here doesn't mean what you did was wrong. There are *VERY* often multiple correct answers to a single question depending on how you interpret it. 
    * For example: If a challenge said "find everyone who likes the band 'Paramore'" and someone listed "'paramre'" (mispelled and lowercased) it's up to you to decide whether you want to build a program that would include that person.
* If you can't see how one of these answers was created, try not to jump straight to trying to fix your answers. Your best way to start debugging is to add a print statement after each line to make sure what you want to have happen is what's really happening.

Expected outputs
================

# 1. Print out the name of the first person who responded to the survey
"Daniel"


# 2. Print out Brenton's second favorite band
"The Format"


# 5. Find the average of the respondents' ages.
33.25


# 6. Print out the percentage of respondents who have brown hair.

# 8. Iterate over the list in order to figure out how many respondents listed "The Office" as one of their favorite shows.
3 people (Daley, Faedra, and Terrace, to be specific)


# 9. Print out a list of all the bands that are liked by at least two people.
#    Pro-tip: some respondents capitalized band names and other respondents did not, so for example, if Panic at the Disco isn't listed, your code isn't accurately reporting your results.
Prince, Alt-J, and Panic! At the Disco


# 10. Identify anyone on the list who has no common interests (bands or shows) with anyone else. Print their names.
Daniel, Mike, and Rebecca
